# Architecture Diagram

# 1. SOC Analyst:
The SOC Analyst is at the core of this architecture. The analyst is responsible for monitoring the network and reviewing alerts and logs generated by various services.
The analyst accesses Elastic & Kibana through a web GUI, which provides an interface for analyzing security data, such as logs and events, visualizing them in dashboards, and setting alerts for suspicious activity.
# 2. AWS Cloud:
The architecture is hosted within AWS. AWS houses the main components of the infrastructure, and everything is connected to the **Internet Gateway (Internet GW)** for communication with external systems.
**VPC (Virtual Private Cloud):** The entire setup is isolated within a VPC with a private network defined by the range 172.31.0.0/24. This ensures that only authorized communication can take place within the network.
# 3. Elastic & Kibana:
These services run within the VPC. Elastic is used for storing and searching security-related logs, while Kibana provides an interactive interface to visualize this data.
Elastic and Kibana are connected to Ticketing Server and Fleet Server to send alerts and logs. The Managed Agents deployed on the servers forward logs to Elastic for analysis.
# 4. Ticketing Server:
This server is responsible for managing security incidents. Once Elastic & Kibana detects an anomaly or a security breach, it creates an alert. These alerts are sent to the Ticketing Server, where they are logged and managed for further investigation.
The SOC Analyst reviews these tickets, investigates the incidents, and takes necessary actions.
# 5. Managed Servers:
The architecture includes various servers in the private network:

  **Windows Server (RDP enabled):** A Windows-based server with RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) enabled. It is used for administrative purposes and manages workloads that require a Windows environment.
  
  **Fleet Server:** A server that coordinates and manages agents across the network, forwarding logs to Elastic for analysis.
  
  **Ubuntu Server (SSH Enabled):** A server running Ubuntu Linux, with SSH (Secure Shell) enabled, allowing remote management and command execution for security tasks.
  
# 6. C2 Server (Mythic):
The C2 Server (Command and Control server) uses the Mythic framework. This is the attacker's server (likely a malicious entity) that communicates with compromised systems within the network.
This is a critical part of the attack flow, where malicious instructions are sent to other systems. The C2 Server communicates with the attacker's Kali Linux machine (visible on the right side of the diagram), which likely initiates and orchestrates the attack.
# 7. Attackerâ€™s Kali Linux:
Kali Linux is used by the attacker for penetration testing or malicious activities. The attacker interacts with the C2 Server and exploits any vulnerabilities in the managed servers (Windows, Ubuntu, etc.).
# 8. Flow of Logs and Alerts:
Logs generated from managed agents on the servers are forwarded to Elastic for storage and analysis. The logs contain information about any anomalous behavior, which may indicate a breach or suspicious activity.
The Elastic & Kibana setup continuously analyzes these logs and triggers alerts. If a potential issue is found, the system raises a ticket on the Ticketing Server, which can be reviewed and acted upon by the SOC Analyst.
# 9. Key Communication Paths:
**SOC Analyst to Elastic/Kibana:** The SOC Analyst connects to Elastic & Kibana via a Web GUI for real-time monitoring and investigation.

**Managed Servers to Elastic:** Managed servers (Windows Server, Fleet Server, and Ubuntu Server) forward logs via agents to Elastic for real-time monitoring.

**Attacker to C2 Server:** The attacker sends commands to the C2 Server, which may then communicate with the compromised systems.

# 10. Security and Network:
The network is secured using SSH and RDP protocols, with each server having access restrictions to ensure that only authorized users can access them. Logs are forwarded for analysis to detect and respond to any malicious activity.

# ELK (ElasticSearch , Logstash, Kibana)
**ELK Stack:**
A collection of three open-source tools (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) used for searching, analyzing, and visualizing log data in real time.

**Elasticsearch:**
A distributed search and analytics engine used for storing and searching data quickly. It's the core component of the ELK stack.

**ESQL (Elasticsearch SQL):**
A query language in Elasticsearch that allows SQL-like syntax to query Elasticsearch data, making it easier for users familiar with SQL to interact with Elasticsearch.

**Kibana:**
A data visualization and exploration tool that works with Elasticsearch. It helps visualize Elasticsearch data using charts, graphs, and dashboards.

**Logstash:**
An open-source tool that collects, processes, and forwards log data to Elasticsearch for indexing. It can handle logs, metrics, and other data formats.

**Beats:**
Lightweight data shippers that send data to Elasticsearch or Logstash. Beats collect logs, metrics, and other types of data from different sources.

**Elastic Agent:**
A unified agent that simplifies managing data collection from various sources and sends it to Elasticsearch or Logstash. It combines the functionalities of different Beats.

**Types of Beats:**

   _**Filebeat:**_ Collects and ships log files.
   _**Metricbeat:**_ Collects system and application metrics.
   _**Packetbeat:**_ Monitors network data for application performance analysis.
   _**Winlogbeat:**_ Collects Windows event logs.
   _**Auditbeat:**_ Monitors audit data from systems.

**ELK vs. Splunk:**
     ELK is an open-source, cost-effective solution primarily focused on search and analytics.
Splunk is a commercial platform known for its robust features, scaling capabilities, and advanced analytics but often comes with higher costs.
**Benefits of ELK:**
- _**Open-source:**_ ELK is free and customizable.
- _**Scalable:**_ It can handle large amounts of data.
- _**Real-time analytics:**_ ELK offers powerful search and analysis capabilities.
- _**Visualization:**_ Kibana enables easy data visualization.
- _**Integration:**_ Works well with various data sources and tools.
